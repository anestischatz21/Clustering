# Customer Segmentation via Wine Property Clustering

**Project:** Customer Segmentation via Wine Property Clustering | Python, Unsupervised Learning

## Objective
Identify hidden segments within red wines based on their physicochemical properties, without using the predefined quality label.

## Action
- Performed **K-Means Clustering** on the dataset, using the **silhouette score** to determine the optimal number of distinct customer segments.  
- Conducted **feature analysis** to interpret and characterize the dominant properties of each discovered cluster.  
- Visualized the high-dimensional clusters in **2D/3D space using PCA** for intuitive interpretation.

## Value
Uncovered **[4] distinct market segments** (e.g., "High-Acidity, Low-Alcohol", "Balanced, Premium"), providing a **data-driven foundation for targeted marketing and product placement strategies**.
